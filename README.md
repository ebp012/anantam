# Anantam
Anantam is a graphing calculator of also graphing complex solutions and inputs.
You can change the x-i viewport to view solutions of complex numbers. For example, if only set to view real parts of solutions, 5 on the x-axis and the x-i viewport set to 7 will grant the real part of the solution on y for 5+7i.

## Checklist for improvements
* Discontinuous functions (holes) ~~and asymptotes~~
* Add a LaTeX ~~function inputter~~
* ~~Tetration functions~~
* Zooming in and out and changing the viewport size
